Project 2: Loan Application Approval Prediction
I. Objective
Development a machine learning model to predict loan appication acceptance or rejection based on  customer details.

II. Dataset Details
1. Dataset source
- Database URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/loan-dataset/data
- Contains customer details for loan decisions (acceptance/rejection).
- Includes attributes such as income, credit history, employment type, and loan amount.

III. Requirements
1. Data Understanding and Cleaning
- Explore the dataset for missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.
- Clean and preprocess the data (e.g handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize correlations between features and loan acceptance/rejection.
- Analyze class distribution (Balance of accepted vs rejection loans).
- Features analysis.
- Try to present all the neccessary information that shows insights from the data or affects your model-building strategy.

3. Model Development
- Train at least three different classification models (e.g Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks).

4. Explainability
- Use techniques like SHAP values or feature importance to explain model predictions.
- Identify which metrics are most important to the problem and explain them.

5. Deployment Simulation (Optional)
- Create a script or simple interface to predict loan decisions for new input data.

6. Report 
- Document data preprocessing, EDA, Model development, and interpretability.
- Compare model performance and justify the final model choice.

Deliverables:
- Source code (Organization and well-commented).
- A r5-minute presentation summarizing findings and a demo of the prediction interface.
- A detailed report (5 - 7 pages).
